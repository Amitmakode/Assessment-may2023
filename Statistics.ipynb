    "A. To determine the percentage of individuals with heights between 160 cm and 180 cm, we can use the properties of the normal distribution. Since the dataset is approximately normally distributed, we can calculate the percentage using the z-scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to find the z-scores for 160 cm and 180 cm using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / σ\n",

    "For 180 cm:\n",
    "z2 = (180 - 170) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a statistical calculator to find the percentage of individuals between these z-scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standard normal distribution table, we find the area under the curve between -1 and 1 is approximately 0.6826. Therefore, approximately 68.26% of individuals in the dataset have heights between 160 cm and 180 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. The distribution of the average height of a random sample of 100 individuals can be approximated by a normal distribution with the same mean but a smaller standard deviation. The standard deviation of the sample mean, also known as the standard error of the mean, can be calculated as σ / √n, where σ is the standard deviation of the population and n is the sample size.\n",

    "In this case, the standard deviation of the sample mean is 10 / √100 = 1.\n",

    "C. To calculate the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm, we can use the formula:\n",

    "D. To find the approximate height corresponding to a threshold below which 5% of the dataset falls, we need to find the z-score associated with the 5th percentile. The z-score can be found using a standard normal distribution table or a statistical calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score corresponding to the 5th percentile is approximately -1.645.\n",

    "\n",
    "x = -1.645 * 10 + 170 = 153.55\n",

    "Therefore, the approximate height corresponding to the threshold where 5% of the dataset has heights below it is approximately 153.55 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "E. The coefficient of variation (CV) is a measure of relative variability and is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, multiplied by 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "F. To calculate the skewness of a dataset, we can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "skewness = (3 * (mean - median)) / standard deviation\n",

    "However, in this case, we are given that the dataset's skewness is approximately zero. This means that the skewness value is close to zero, indicating that the dataset is symmetrically distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "A skewness value of zero suggests that the dataset is symmetrically distributed. This means that the data is evenly distributed around the mean, and there is no significant skewness to either the left or right side of the distribution. In other words, the heights of the individuals in this dataset are evenly spread around the mean height of 170 cm, without any notable bias towards shorter or taller heights."

    "A. To conduct a t-test and determine if there is a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between the two groups, we can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: State the hypotheses:\n",
    "- Null hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the mean improvement scores between Group A and Group B.\n",
    "- Alternative hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between Group A and Group B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Set the significance level (α):\n",
    "The significance level (α) is given as 0.05 in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Compute the test statistic:\n",
    "We can use the independent two-sample t-test to compare the means of two independent groups. The formula for the test statistic is:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (mean1 - mean2) / sqrt((s1^2 / n1) + (s2^2 / n2))\n",
    "\n",
    "where mean1 and mean2 are the means of Group A and Group B, s1 and s2 are the standard deviations of Group A and Group B, and n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of Group A and Group B, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the given values:\n",
    "mean1 = 2.5, mean2 = 2.2, s1 = 0.8, s2 = 0.6, n1 = n2 = 30\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (2.5 - 2.2) / sqrt((0.8^2 / 30) + (0.6^2 / 30))\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Determine the critical value:\n",
    "The critical value for a two-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 58 degrees of freedom (df = n1 + n2 - 2) can be obtained from the t-distribution table or using statistical software. For a significance level of 0.05, the critical value is approximately ±2.001.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Compare the test statistic with the critical value:\n",
    "If the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. In this case, we compare the absolute value of the test statistic with the critical value (±2.001). If the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than 2.001, we reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the calculated test statistic and the critical value, if the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than 2.001, we can conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between Group A and Group B. If the absolute value of the test statistic is less than or equal to 2.001, we do not have enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference between the two groups."
